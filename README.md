This code is for Python 3.5

Example: 
      In python 2.7, you import the instance urllib which in turn is used with the fucntion urlopen()
      
      -- Import urllib
      .
      .
      . xx = urllib.urlopen()
      
      However in python 3.7, it is different. The intance urllib is replaced with urllib.request.
      
      --import urllib.request
      .
      .
      .xx = urllib.request.urlopen()
